# Here is the statement :
- The ability to create a new game (New Game)
- The ability to hold the current score (Hold)
- The ability to roll the dice (Roll Dice)
- The ability to have 2 players

# :page_facing_up: Rules of the game : 

The game includes 2 players on a single screen.
Each player has a temporary score (ROUND) and an overall score (GLOBAL).
In each turn, the player's ROUND is initialized to 0, and they can roll a dice as many times as they want. The result of each roll is added to the ROUND.

* During their turn, the player can choose to:
  - Click on the "Hold" option to transfer the points from ROUND to GLOBAL. Then, it will be the other player's turn.
  - Roll the dice. If they get a 1, their ROUND score is lost, and their turn ends.
  - The first player to reach 100 points in GLOBAL wins the game.
